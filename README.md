An app to store books you have read, or would like to read.

## Technologies Used
* Html: 

Search Bar:  The user will have the ability to type in a reactive search bar that will limit the books shown to ones with titles matching what the user has typed.  

Add/Remove Books:  At the bottom of the page the user can find an option to add a book, providing a title, series name, genre, and an image address. Or remove a book based on it's book number as it is displayed.

(Any book without a proper image address will be generated with out one) 

* JS:  

Library Array:  An array of book objects with a preset of 20 books already added for the user.  The array is automatically adjusted when a book is added or removed. 

Display function:  A function that takes every object in the Library array and creates individual elements for them in the HTML for them to be displayed.  

* CSS:  

Responsive Design:  The page will change the size of the book elements being displayed to better fit the size of the screen.
